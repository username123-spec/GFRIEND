# GFRIEND: Generative Few-shot Reward Inference through Efficient DPO

This is the official implementation of GFRIEND: Generative Few-shot Reward Inference through Efficient DPO. The core process includes:
1. **SFT**: Supervised fine-tuning of the base model using a small amount of (question, chain-of-thought) data to enable it to generate high-quality thoughts/reasoning.
2. **Preference Refinement**: Sampling multiple times on data with preference labels to generate diverse CoT (chain-of-thought) and judgment results, and expanding and fine-grainedly distinguishing preference data based on perplexity scoring.
3. **M-DPO**: Weighted Direct Preference Optimization training on the above multi-level preference data.

## Dataset

The project primarily utilizes the following two types of datasets for training and evaluation as described in the paper:

1. **General Domain Dataset**: We selected the publicly available ["Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2"]("Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2") as the base preference data. For few-shot scenarios, we used a small number of high-quality samples (approximately 3,000) for experimentation and tested on public benchmarks such as

- [Reward Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench) A dataset for evaluating the capabilities of reward models, covering multiple categories including chat, reasoning, and safety, is designed to test the performance of reward models in complex and structured queries.
- [UltraFeedback](https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraFeedback) A large-scale, fine-grained, and diverse preference dataset, containing prompts from various resources, and annotated by GPT-4 in four aspects: instruction following, authenticity, honesty, and usefulness.
- [PKU-SafeRLHF](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/safe-rlhf) A human-annotated preference dataset, containing over 300,000 human-labeled comparison data points, covering preferences for usefulness and harmlessness, aimed at promoting research on the safe alignment of large language models.


2. **Medical Domain Dataset**: To verify the effectiveness of the method in specialized scenarios, the paper constructed a medical preference dataset simulating a low-resource environment based on the [iCliniq](https://www.icliniq.com/) dataset. The dataset consists of 3,500 entries, with 3,000 used for training and 500 for validation. The data is derived from anonymized segments of real clinical conversations and publicly available medical data. It has undergone deduplication, normalization, anonymization, and expert annotation to form a structured preference format of (question, answer_pos, answer_neg).

When reproducing or conducting research using the above datasets, please note the following points:

- The preprocessing and filtering methods for the general domain dataset are detailed in the paper and script comments. It is recommended to ensure that there is no overlap between the training and test sets before training.
- If you have other custom preference data (such as for question-answering or dialogue scenarios), you can also integrate it into the same process in the format of (question, answer_neg, answer_pos).

## Experimental Results

### Main Results

*Table 1:Accuracy of models’ judges on the test sets of Ultra-Feedback, PKU-SafeRLHF, and Reward-Bench. BT-model, ArmoRM and GFRIEND are trained on 3000 samples of Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 based
on Llama3-8B-Instruct.*
